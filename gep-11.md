## Contributions

As contributors, you can contribute/modify to the available resources, as well as propose and/or participate directly in the communication actions. To do this, contributors follow the classic GEP posting/modifying process. If specified in the Actor(s) category, a contributor can participate directly in a communication action by following the indications provided therein.

## Requirements

> All the requirements and prerequisites for communication should be included here.

As an open source project and community, we cannot accept that communication is "wild". We cannot accept any method or message that may harm any other person or entity and more generally any action that would result in a court decision in any jurisdiction. An action that is related or is similar to spam or is not respect the code of conduct should be immediately rejected. Such behaviour must be monitored and a decision to sanction the contributor who proposed or make it should be taken into consideration. 

In order to comply with our own security considerations, Grapp should never claim to be secure in itself, this would be a lack of rigour. We cannot use this as communication argument because it is incompatible with the way the software is distributed and responsibilities that could be held on to the end-user in case of failure. However, Grapp helps the end-user to adopt good practices, high standards and promotes the adoption of automated processes on the security in applications and infrastructures with its tools.

## Communication action

As an open source project, communications actions are publicly available and fully transparent. Each communication action is the subject of a Type I (Informationnal) GEP which sould act as a communication plan for each action carried out. In it, it is necessary to determine for the action, the following sections for the relevant GEPs :
- objective(s), 
- target(s),
- actor(s),
- channel(s),
- strategy,
- message,
- budget, if applicable,
- timetable and follow-up

All these concepts are defined below in the "Definitions" section. A template for writing a GEP for a communication action is available here:
-  [GEP#997: Template for communication action(s)](./gep-997.md).

In order to facilitate the classification of communication actions, they must comply with the above points and be published under a number starting __11*__ (E-g, 11001, 1161, 115...). These numbers are explicitly reserved for this purpose.

## Definitions

### Objective(s)

The objectives should be [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria), understood as follows:
- __Specific__ : The action must be directly related to the project and its needs. It must be clear and precise enough to be understood.
- __Measurable__ : It is important to be able to measure the impact of our action and it is therefore necessary to determine on which indicator the objective is based. This makes it possible to determine whether our action has been effective and to be able to monitor, fill in the follow-up and, if necessary, adapt or revise the communication plan during the action.
- __Acceptable and Ambitious__ : The objective must be ambitious enough to be motivating and achievable in order to maintain optimism.
- __Realistic__ : The objective must be motivating but it must also be realistic in relation to the capacity of the project. This provides a long-term view of the objective, which must be achievable and not detract from its progress.
- __Time-based__ : It is necessary to provide one or more deadlines for communications actions that are appropriate to the objective. These date(s) act as milestones to monitor the effectiveness of the action. If an action is expected to continue, a plan can be renewed and therefore a date must always be provided.


### Target(s)

Although it may be abstract, effective communication is aimed at a particular target. Targets must be determined in order to precise and adapt the message or channels used.

### Actor(s)

The actors of the actions must be absolutely defined. As an open source project and community, we cannot accept that communication is "wild". This is why it must be agreed, when establishing an action, who (and how) has the capacity and legitimacy to carry it out on behalf of the community.

### Channel(s)

The choice of channel(s) used for the action should be appropriate to the action. It must be determined and the action must respect and be appropriate to its use.

### Strategy

Communication and action are built around a strategy. The strategy given should be fairly simple and understandable. It should be described as precisely as possible and describe how it can achieve the objective(s).

### Message

The message is the content and form of the communication. It is the details and information that will be distributed through the chosen channels. The message must be as precise as possible, adapted to the targets, the channels, the objectives pursued and the strategy adopted. It must also respect all the rules and considerations (philosophical, graphical or design, security...) issued within the project.

The message as __content__ must relate to the plan provided in the relevant GEP and not deviate from the rules issued by that GEP.

The message as __form__ can be a text, an image, a resource that contains the communication described in the plan.  

### Budget

__Not currently applicable__ : The project is not currently supported by any funds. Any communication by private funds is forbidden. Communication via free channels is implicitly encouraged. If the project is supported by any funds, then the communication will benefit from an allocated budget and all details concerning the use of these funds will be described in this section.

### Timetable and follow-up

In the plan, the target dates and their recurrence(s) corresponding to the milestones and objectives must be determined. The timetable is used to determine and track the progress of the action(s). Your timetable should include the indicators selected in the objectives and it should be noted, as defined in the recurrences, the evolution of these indicator(s). Wherever possible the follow up and these dates are in the form of a table.

Once this is determined, a follow-up should be included in a table below and should be updated. A communication action creates a flow of information and makes a mandatory monitoring. It is necessary to ensure that the action is going in the right direction and log its indicators. Wherever possible the follow up and these dates are in the form of one or more tables corresponding to an objective which include :
- the target date
- indicator(s) of the objective concerned
- (Possibly) the delta in relation to the initial objective
- A note on the progress hat could help in decision making

The aim is to have a relatively readable and complete follow-up, which makes misinterpretations difficult and facilitates decision-making.

_E-g (the examples given are not error-free and are for illustrative purposes):_

__Main objective__ : Increasing the visibility of the project, 1000 stars in Github at the end of Q1 2021
 
__At every week__ :
- Publish a note about changes
- Documenting progress
 
| Start Date | End Date | Objective |
|-|-|-|
| Start of Q1 2020 | Start of Q1 2021 | 1000 stars on Github |
| Week 1 | Week 5 | Average of 5 stars per week |
| Week 5 | Week 15 | Average of 15 stars per week |
...

__Stars in Github follow-up :__

| Date | Stars | Average | Objective | Delta | Note |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Week 1 | 2 (+2) | 2 | 5 | -3 (-3) | [...] |
| Week 2 | 8 (+6) | 4 | 5 | -4 (-1) | [...] |
