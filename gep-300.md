## Introduction

This is a glossary of security terms and definitions.

## Definitions

Some terms relative to security may be used in the GEPS. Wherever possible, they are defined, corrected and refined in this common glossary.

### Assocations and Non-profit Organizations related to information security

Is hightly encouraged the use of documents and recommendations by Internationnal or nationnal non-profit organization related to information security and in particular the documents and standards that have a legal aspect for the most fastidious use cases :
- [OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org/)
- [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/)
- [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/) ([CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/))
- [ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/)
- [NSCS](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/)
- [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/)

This list is not intended to be exhaustive, is open, is given for information only and is not necessarily free of errors nor exceptions.

### Courtesy limit

The courtesy limit is the limit induced where confidentiality needs to be preserved. This abstract concept can be used in project discussions and specifications. This limit prohibits the possibility of communication of sensitive data or sensitive information or sensitive variable to any actor other than the end-user specified recipient(s).

### Cryptography

Cryptography is a discipline and an art. Cryptography is an essential mechanism in computer security. Being able to judge its principles requires a great deal of knowledge in the field. These principles are not abstract and all recognized cryptographic designs are defined by a standard so as to prove its real capacity.

### Good practices

Good practices are all practices recognized and validated by the community and which are based on practices recognized by standards or the use of standards and any recommendations issued by associations or non-profit organizations related to information security.

### Secure acknowledgement

Secure acknowledgement is any permission induced by a security requirement. This permission is authorised, denied or partial by a mechanism specified by a standard or chosen by the end user and is registered, logged, recorded and/or notified by an adequate means.

### Secure channels

A secure channel is a means of transport for information (e-g sensitive data) which is framed by recognized cryptographic principles, standardized and adequate to a certain level of security wich meets security requirements of the information. Any communication or exchange of __sensitive variables__, even in unreadable format, must be done through secure channels.

### Sensitive Data and Variables

Sensitive data is data that poses a security threat if exposed or intercepted by a malicious third party. More broadly, it is any data considered sensitive by the user. It should not be confused with, nor replace, the principle of transparency. In the case of remote access via SSH, this data can be: host, port, password, private key file. In the context of a web server, the `Server: Tornado 5.1.1` header can be considered sensitive data as it contains information that the user [may not wish to disclose](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/2935). This also include personnal data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual. 

Sensitive variables are computer variables containing senstive data. They are stored in memory, managed by the OS or by a standard memory allocation library. They can circulate on the network or be visible at the screen of by an other software component if they are not framed. They must be protected against interception or made unreadable by any other components or actors than the final recipient if they are exposed or if there is a risk that they will be exposed. The transmission of sensitive data takes place through secure channels and is subject to a secure acknowledgement.

### Single point of failure (SPOF)

A single point of failure (or SPOF) is a vulnerable system component on which the entire system depends.  By definition, a system component provides a service. An attack on an SPOF aim to alter the integrity or the continuity of this service. A SPOF is defined in a system when a dependency on a single vulnerable service is identified. This is a service requirement and a security requirement. The most common mechanism to protect against an SPOF is redundancy and/or diversification. Redundancy of essential components in systems and diversification that depend on them must be encouraged.

### Standards

The use of standards alone __is not enough to justify any security__ (_e-g_ Heartbleed in OpenSSL, [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0160)). What makes any software secure is its ability to do so, in continous and also to have it integrated into a continuous improvement process. It must be noted that a standard is primarily theoretical and that it is important to justify of a proper implementation, integrity and monitoring.

Of course are recognized the standards issued from the most prestigious organizations, such as :
- [ISO](https://www.iso.org/home.html) like [ISO/IEC 27000](https://www.iso.org/standard/73906.html), [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) and [ISO/IEC 27002](https://www.iso.org/standard/54533.html) series
- [RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/) from [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) like [RFC4251](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4251)

Are also recognized the standards and recommendations from Assocations and Non-profit Organizations Organizations related to information security and cybersecurity (see above), such as :
- [NIST Special Publication 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecretver) 
- [BSI-Standard 200-2](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/International/bsi-standard-2002_en_pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2)
- [ANSSI-PA-079](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2021/03/anssi-guide-selection_crypto-1.0.pdf)
- [WSTG - v4.2](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/)

We promote the development of free and open source software, which is why the use of all standards resulting from the movements of free and open source software and protocols are also encouraged (_e-g_ [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)).

This list is not intended to be exhaustive, is open, is given for information only and is not necessarily free of errors nor exceptions.

Any standard, document or recommendations issued by a for-profit organization or by a company lobbying for companies selling information security related products or more broadly a document that could present any conflict of interest should be taken with caution to ensure the neutrality of the project.

Each GEP(s) dealing with a standard must provide the arguments, explanations, resources and/or sources that allow to appreciate and understand this choice and take all necessary security considerations. The adoption of one standard rather than another must be justified and leave the debate open. Compatibility with a standard can be full or partial and must be specified.
