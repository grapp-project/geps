## Introduction

This is a draft paper about Vulnerability remediation procedure.

## Security Bulletins

All the information collected and issued by the project on its knowns software vulnerabilities are included in [Security Bulletins](gep-31.md).

## Tricycle

These three cyclical steps is intented to form a continuous vulnerability management system. This tricycle contains three phases :
- Monitoring
- Reporting
- Fixing

These continuous phases must be communicative and involve contributors and end-users in order to provide the necessary information, documentation, recommendations and fixes to a possible vulnerability or threat.

### Monitoring

As contributors, members and end-users, we should to provide a continuous monitoring. Users can use different means to publish information about a possible breach, which is why information gathering can be complicated. Wherever possible, information flows and tools should be provided to end-users and contributors for monitoring. In this continuous phase, contributors and end users are linked. As best as possible, documentation, vulnerability detection tools and tests should be used, standardized and carried out to improve this capacity.

Test sets to verify the integrity of features should be provided to contributors. If these tests do not pass then contributors should re-evaluating the code provided or otherwise optimising the tests performed.

Specific tools and tests for threat detection are not necessarily included in the project sources. These are tools intended for contributors and users wishing to evaluate the security of the software. As end users or contributors you are under no obligation to provide tests and detection solutions which may be private.

### Reporting

In order to bring transparency and necessary information to a common effort, a diagnosis should be established and his documentation provided. The basis of these reports are the Security Bulletins.

In order to provide information in a reasonnable delay, a security bulletins should be published to provide provsionnal recommendations even if the diagnosis or the remediation is incomplete. Once a vulnerability is discovered or a threat is possible, a security bulletin should be published. All information on progress and follow-up should be collected in the relevant Security Bulletin.

### Fixing

Code considered vulnerable should be patched as soon as possible. Security patches take priority over feature development. A security patch should implicitly reduce the scope of the vulnerability and not increase it. Security patches must not make a version incompatible.
