## Introduction

This document provides code style guidelines inside Grapp projects and repositories.

## Information

Any source file that does not meet this coding standard may be rejected.

## Python code style

Python's code inside the grapp project should comply with the [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and the following rules :
- Indentation is 4 spaces, no tabs.
- 120 characters maximum length for one line.

### Check code style

Before making a push, it is suggested to use the grapp-contrib tool and its  command `grapp-contrib codestyle checkdir .` to alert you to possible errors and possibly auto-correct them.
