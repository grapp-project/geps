## Introduction

Communication about a very early state and to create a community dynamic.

## Objective(s)

The main objective of this very first communication action is to tease out the genesis of the project and invite to contribute or follow to it.

Contributions and follows are easily measurable through git and Github tools directly. It should be monitored and recorded at every week the number of :
- Stars
- Issues
- Fork
- PR

The arbitrarily set target of total Stars, Issues, Fork and Pull Requests is at least of 500 by spring 2022.

> Assuming a 1% conversion rate for each of the above actions, the number of unique visitors should be ~50000.

Further actions or revision may be made to achieve this objective.

## Target(s)

- Python developpers
- Linux users
- Project owner or project manager looking for innovative solutions for infrastructure management
- Early contributors

## Actor(s)

- Website contributors and early contributors.

## Channel(s)

- SEO
- Front page of the website
- Github

## Strategy

This communication action is part of an outreach strategy :
- Promoting free and open source software
- Improving what already exists
- Create a dynamic around the project
- To commit to sustainability

## Message

The project is not yet published and is not yet mature or has enough reviews to be considered for public distribution.

The key messages of the project are :
- Free et open source
- Ambitious
- Infrastructure as Code, Automation, Framework
- As easy as possible to understand

Some limitations should also be clearly indicated :
- this project is at a very early stage, under developement and needs contributors
- Python project
- Linux focused

`__future__` is a Python keyword that is well known for its developer. The pun could be considered and used to communicate the future state of the project. It could be a good way to get attention.

A very brief but accurate description of the project should be provided to visitors. A playful, almost educational, message and content can be put in place to communicate the "as easy as possible to understand" aspect. Also, in order to provide this for most people, translations may be made.

The contents of the GEP(s) and documentation should be sufficient on their own to allow a good understanding of the project as a whole, but should not be too complex, which could lead to friction for first contributors.
